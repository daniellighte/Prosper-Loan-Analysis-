It also contains 81 different attributes such as original loan amount, Borrowers APR & Rate, Loan Term, The specific Listing Number, Employment Status, Current Loan Status etc. The dataset can be found here https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv

## Summary of Findings

In this dataset exploration I sought out to find the relationship between BorrowerAPR, Income Range, Employment Status and how it relates to the Loan Status. I also sought to understand how customers who had verifiable income and/or owned homes performed in loan repayment.

I first of all found at that Borrower Rate and APR were very much strongly correlated infcat they were borderline interchangeable in a trend based analysis. I then found at that unemployed customers had higher APR which resulted in unfavourable loan statuses. The higher the Prosper Rating, the lower the APR and also the more likely the person is not going to default. In another finding, customer who owned houses and had verifiable income had lower chances of defaulting on the loan or having Prosper have to write off the loan. Customers who had lower Prosper Ratings ultimately had higher APR. Finally, I noticed that having a high income would help in having a lower APR irregardless of the amount.

## Key Sights for Presentation


For the Presentation, I focused on the Influence of Borrower APR and Income Ranges on variables such as Loan Status, Employment Status and Loan Term. I started by plotting the different distribution of the variables and then followed by using box plots, violin plots and boxen plots to get a better understanding of the relationships between the variables i had interest on.
